# Recipe_Store

A Recipe Store website has several use cases for its users. Firstly, it provides users with access to a wide range of recipes, making it a useful resource for anyone who wants to
cook or experiment with new dishes. Users can search for specific recipes by name or keyword, and filter results by categories such as cuisine, dietary requirements, cooking
time, and difficulty level.

Secondly, the website allows users to get recipe suggestions based on the ingredients they have on hand. This feature can be especially useful for users who want to use up
ingredients they already have instead of going to the store to buy new ones. The website can suggest recipes that use those ingredients, thereby minimizing waste and
saving time.

ingredients, cooking time, difficulty level, and cuisine. They can also manage user accounts, view their details, and resolve any issues or queries that user might have
